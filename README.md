#### About this project - what I learned.
* javascript: There was a template already in place for adding elements to the DOM. A lot of string replacements were used to manipulate the data and push it to the DOM.
* JSON: first introduction to the JSON format
* jQuery: first use of selectors
* CSS: separation of CSS into a style sheet
